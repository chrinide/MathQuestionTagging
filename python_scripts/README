Order in which to run scripts:

  1. python separate_tagged_untagged_content.py
  2. python extract_question_tag_info.py 
  3. python find_keywords_in_text.py 
  4. python top_latex_by_keyword.py
  5. python split_train_test_data.py

These files that are created are then used in the baseline_feature_extractor script to create the baseline model.

Otherwise, the files are then analyzed in the iPython notebook files in the .. directory.
