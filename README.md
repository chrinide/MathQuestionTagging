This repo contains my analysis of the MAA's WebWorK Open Question Library.

My goal is to analyze those questions that have been tagged with keywords in order
to train a classifier to come up with an automated way of tagging new questions.

The analysis is implemented in Python and the scripts depend on NumPy, pandas and scikit-learn
for the machine learning algorithms.
